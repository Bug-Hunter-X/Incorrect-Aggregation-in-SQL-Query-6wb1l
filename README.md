This repository contains an example of a common SQL error: incorrect use of aggregate functions without a GROUP BY clause.  The `bug.sql` file demonstrates the problematic query, which produces an incorrect average order total and total order count.  The `bugSolution.sql` file shows the corrected query, using GROUP BY to calculate the aggregates per group (in this case there is only one group, so the result is correct).
